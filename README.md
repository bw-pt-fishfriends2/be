<br/>

## API
The leading URI for all endpoints provided below is: `https://fish-friends-resources.herokuapp.com`, simply add the endpoint URL and any relevant body JSON, headers, or queries to access resources.

### 🔐 Auth

<br/>

- `POST` to `/api/register` with the following user object attached to the request body:
> ```js
> {
>   "username": "someUsername", // must be at least 2 characters long
>   "password": "somePassword" // must be at least 4 characters long
> }
> ```

<br/>

- `POST` to `/api/login` with the following user object attached to the request body:
> ```js
> {
>   "username": "someUsername", // must be at least 2 characters long
>   "password": "somePassword" // must be at least 4 characters long
> }
> ```

<br/>

Both the `/register` and `/login` endpoints return an object containing a token _if_ the request is sent correctly. That object will look like this:
>  ```js
>  {
>    "id": 0,
>    "username": "someUsername",
>    "token": "aReallyLongStringOfJibberishThatNeedsToBeSentToTheAPIAsAnAuthorizationHeaderOnEveryRequestToRestrictedRoutes"
>  }
>  ```
The Id and Username are made availble immediately to the client on successful login or register, as well as the token that must be sent as an Authorization header on conesecutive requests.

---
❗ ALL ROUTES BELOW ARE PROTECTED AND MUST USE A TOKEN ❗
  
---

> There is a single login that is the main reference point for all seeded data. Feel free to add logs using this user, or register a new one. Simply keep track of any passwords you create.
> > Login >>> username: "Lambda" password: "1234"
